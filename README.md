# eProfile
eProfile is a directories and files manager with various unique features. 


It was built on Laravel framework of PHP, I completely developed it alone. It was my first very interesting and typical project which I personally liked it developing it's modules which I had never done it.

It's functionalities are given below:

1) This system consists of directories and files of different companies which only admin can add and edit company.

2) Every company has unique directories and files.

3) Admin can create user and assign his/her company or more than one company.

4) User and Admin can upload multiple files in different directories in JPG, PDF, PNG, DOCX, XLS format.

5) Here comes a biggest challenging module : User and admin can merge different files having different formats i.e. jpg,doc,xls ,pdf into a single PDF file and also can add watermark on that merged file. I did it without using any external API or VPS service.

6) You can also attach merged file and send mail.

7) You can also download individual files and also merged file.

Etc
